# Welcome to my Github Profile! 🚀

Hi, I'm a full-stack software engineer from Brazil 🇧🇷, currently residing in Berlin 🇩🇪. With over 10 years of experience in the field 💻, I have a strong background in PHP and Typescript. In the frontend, I have expertise in VueJS and ReactJS.

I am also the developer behind Pizzuno 🍕, a fun and addictive online multiplayer game similar to UNO.

I believe in writing clean, readable and maintainable code 🛠️. I enjoy working on challenging projects 💡 and continuously learning and improving my skills 📚.

Feel free to take a look at my projects 📂, and connect with me 🙋‍♂️ if you want to discuss anything related to software engineering 🤖, Music 🎶, Rick and Morty, or The Office.
